2. WordsAPI: This is a paid API but it offers a free plan which includes 2500 requests per month. It is a comprehensive API that provides access to more than 150,000 words and phrases.

3. Merriam-Webster Dictionary API: This is a free API provided by the Merriam-Webster dictionary. It provides access to a wide range of data, including definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and more.

4. Oxford Dictionaries API: This is a paid API but it offers a free plan which includes 1000 requests per month. It provides access to the Oxford Dictionaries data.
